# Solar-Optimization
A program that will minimize the amount of and cost of solar panels and storage devices for a household based on the power usage.

The goal of this program is to take input data from power consumption of a home and use this data to find the optimal amount of 
solar panels for this home. The goal is to minimize the cost while still meeting the home's energy needs. Factors that are aimed
to be taken account for are total area of usable space (for the solar panel), budget of the project, incident solar rays at 
various longitude and latitudes, power production from various panels, and others to be added as the project progresses. The 
project also aims to incorporate the minimization of storage, if desired, for the home. The factos to be considered here are 
length of duration that the storage can provide to the home (in case of Power System Failure), budget for storage, alloted area
for the storage devices, and others to be added as the project progresses.
